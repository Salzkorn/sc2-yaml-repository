# This is an example demonstrating how to use custom mission orders to create simple race-swapped campaigns.
# As with all custom mission orders, this requires setting "mission_order: custom" in your YAML to work.

# With all of the below, be wary of Zerg possibly not having enough missions to fill the longer campaigns.

  custom_mission_order:
    # This is a descriptive name for our custom campaign
    Zerg WoL:
      # This loads a campaign preset (see Custom Mission Order docs for a complete list, otherwise just use WoL/HotS/LotV/NCO and Mini variants)
      preset: mini wol
      # This sets default options for all the layouts in this campaign
      global:
        # This sets the allowed pool of missions for all layouts to be the "Zerg Missions" mission group
        mission_pool: zerg missions

    # Since multiple campaigns can be in the same mission order, if you want to use this example, make sure to remove the campaigns you don't want
    T+Z LotV:
      preset: lotv
      global:
        # You can use a list of mission groups to add them together
        mission_pool:
        - zerg missions
        - terran missions

    Protoss HotS with Keys:
      preset: mini hots
      # Campaign presets accept this keys option, similar to the key_mode option for regular mission orders
      # "keys: missions" adds a key to every mission
      # "keys: layouts" adds a key to every layout
      keys: missions
      global:
        # You can use ~ to remove a mission group from the pool
        # The following makes a pool of Protoss missions, then removes all no-build and race-swap missions
        # See the docs for a complete list of instructions for mission pools
        mission_pool:
          - protoss missions
          - ~ no-build missions
          - ~ raceswap missions
