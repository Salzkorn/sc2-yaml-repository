# This is an example using various features of custom mission orders to create a short campaign.
# As with all custom mission orders, this requires setting "mission_order: custom" in your YAML to work.

# Custom mission orders have the following basic format:
#
# custom_mission_order:
#   <campaign name>:
#     some_campaign_option: value
#     <layout name>:
#       # Layouts always require a type and size
#       type: grid
#       size: 4
#       some_layout_option: value
#
# Campaigns can contain multiple layouts, and the mission order can contain multiple campaigns.

# For more details on available options, please see the Custom Mission Order documentation.

  custom_mission_order:
    Archipelago!:
      max_difficulty: hard # This limits the campaign to end with hard missions
      Victory Island:
        type: grid
        size: 4
        exit: true # This makes this layout the campaign's goal (the default is the last layout)
        missions: # This modifies mission slots directly
          - index: [1, 2] # On a size 4 grid these are the top right and bottom left slots
            entry_rules:
              # This entry rule requires beating 4 mission from the Archipelago! campaign
              - scope: Archipelago!
                amount: 4
          - index: 3
            entry_rules:
              - scope: Archipelago!
                amount: 7
      Zerg Atoll:
        type: column
        size: 2
        entry_rules:
          # This entry rule requires beating the exact mission at index 0 in the Victory Island layout in this campaign
          # Index 0 is usually the default entrance (or starter mission) of a layout
          - scope: ../Victory Island/0
        # This sets the possible mission for this layout to be only missions from the "Zerg Missions" mission group
        mission_pool: zerg missions
      Terran Cove:
        type: column
        size: 2
        entry_rules:
          - scope: ../Victory Island/0
        mission_pool: terran missions
      Protoss Peninsula:
        type: column
        size: 2
        entry_rules:
          - scope: ../Victory Island/0
        mission_pool: protoss missions
